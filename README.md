## Introduction

Our mission at SUMM AI is to make information accessible for everyone at the click of a button. This includes not only the translation of complex texts into Easy Language (Leichte Sprache) but also the use of easy illustrations to support understanding.

This project focuses on the generation and search of images for Easy Language texts by providing comprehensive pipelines for both functionalities. The image generation pipeline allows you to fine-tune an image generation model using your own image dataset. The image search pipeline enables you to search for specific images within an existing image database using text queries. Both pipelines are integrated with Gradio apps to simplify access for endusers.


## Repository Overview

This repository is organized into two main modules:

1. **Image Generation**:  
   This module includes a comprehensive pipeline for fine-tuning an image generation model using your own image dataset. Additionally, it provides an inference pipeline integrated in a Gradio app. The app allows users to convert Easy Language (Leichte Sprache) text into image prompts and generate images using the fine-tuned model.

2. **Image Search**:  
   This module includes a pipeline to enable image search within a dataset. Users can input a dataset of images and search for specific images using text queries. A Gradio app is included to simplify access for endusers.
